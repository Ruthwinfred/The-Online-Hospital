	<h class="screen-only">Over the years, we've had healthcare apps that help people get the medical help they need. But then it was realised that safety on these apps matters alot. Patients need to be sure about who is giving them medical services and if these people are qualified. This' the reason why The Online Hospital has been developed. Instead of gazing about a doctor online, just find them in your trusted hospitals. Chose a hospital of your interest and be directed on a doctor that suits you. Likewise, many people visit hospitals for reasons that could be sorted via a call or text chart. Why would you wait on a queue for a consultation that could have been done online? How about checkups that need no laboratory or direct examination? These can be done online via video, audio or text chats.Lastly, it's believed that these online medical services works best in private facilities. No! This should not be the case. The government can employ online doctors in the public hospitals to deal with patients doing online visits.</h>
